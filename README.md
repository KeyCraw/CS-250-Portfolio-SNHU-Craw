# CS-250-Portfolio-SNHU-Craw

Welcome to my CS 250 portfolio! This repository contains my coursework and projects from the CS 250 Software Developement Lifecycle class.

## About This Course
CS 250 focuses on Java programming fundamentals, software development concepts, and Agile methodologies, including Scrum. Throughout the course, I have completed coding assignments, lab exercises, and written papers on Agile project management and Scrum practices.

## Repository Contents
- **Java Programming Assignments:** Code files demonstrating Java concepts such as classes, exception handling, linked lists, and practical projects like a Travel Slideshow and Travel Sheet application.
- **Scrum and Agile Papers:** Written reflections and case studies on Scrum roles, Agile communication, and team collaboration.
- **Final Project:** A retrospective analysis reflecting on lessons learned from Agile project experiences.

## How to Use
Explore the folders to view my Java code and Agile project documentation. Each assignment includes detailed comments and explanations. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!

## Sprint Review and Retrospective

For my final project, I completed a Sprint Review and Retrospective paper and a presentation for the SNHU Travel project. These reflect my experience taking on every Scrum role: Product Owner, Developer, Tester, and Scrum Master. They show how Agile practices help teams work together, adapt to change, and deliver value.

## Reflection Questions

1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating user stories help with this?
I start by listening carefully to what users need and then breaking that down into clear, manageable tasks called user stories. Each story has specific acceptance criteria so everyone knows when it is complete. Creating user stories makes it easier to understand what the user wants and reduces confusion during development. It also encourages ongoing feedback from stakeholders so we can adjust before writing code.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to use in the future?
I approach development in small steps. I focus on building a small piece of functionality, testing it, and then improving it based on feedback. I hope to continue using Agile practices like sprint planning, daily check-ins, retrospectives, backlog prioritization, and continuous testing. These steps keep projects flexible, prevent wasted work, and make sure the software meets user needs.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means communicating clearly, being reliable, and helping the team reach shared goals. It also means listening, being open to feedback, and supporting others. In my project, I asked questions when things were unclear, shared progress updates, and collaborated on testing to make sure the work was accurate. Creating a positive environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing ideas is just as important as completing the tasks.
